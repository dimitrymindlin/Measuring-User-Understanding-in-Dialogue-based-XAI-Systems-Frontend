    <h2>This experiment has three parts as described before. In the learning part, you'll try to guess what the machine
        learning model will predict. After guessing, you'll see the model's actual prediction and get explanations to
        understand its reasoning. In the testing parts, you'll make similar guesses without seeing the model's
        reasoning,
        using what you learned earlier. Your guesses are about if the machine learning model predicts that an individual
        is a low or high risk loan applicant. You'll go through several rounds of this process to
        better grasp how the model makes predictions about different people's earnings.</h2>
